# Javascript-roadmap
This repository is designed to help review and reinforce fundamental JavaScript concepts through hands-on exercises. Each folder focuses on a specific topic and contains:

- A `README.md` with concise explanations and examples
- Practical exercises to solidify understanding

## Topics Covered

- [01-Event Loop](01-event-loop/README.md) - Understanding the JavaScript event loop, call stack, and asynchronous programming.
- Closures
- Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await)
- Scopes
- Hoisting
- Prototypes
- `this` keyword
- Callbacks
- ES6+ features

More topics may be added as needed.

## Purpose

The goal is to build a structured and practical learning environment where you can revisit key JavaScript concepts in isolation, understand how they work under the hood, and practice implementing them through small, focused examples.

Feel free to fork, clone, and expand the repository as you continue learning!
